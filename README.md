Hi!!!!

This is a chess roguelike (enginebuilder???) game I'm working on!

I'm pretty early on in development, with a basic prototype for the combat completed, and am currently developing the actual rogue like elements.

If you're interested in helping out, bugs will be added to issues as I discover them (and decide to make them a future alex problem). Alternatively, you can always PR any features you'd want to add, or send me any ideas.

If you are an artist and are interested please please please pretty please ğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥º reach out i am terrible at making sprites
