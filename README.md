# About
============================

Hi! This is a rogue like chess game I've been developing. It works similar to chess, except "piece attacking" functions slightly differently, and it also has unique upgrades to strengthen your pieces.

If you're interested in trying it, you can clone the repository, and open it in the unity engine to run it. In the future their will be a build and an itch page.

# Contribution

I'd love any contributions or help! If you're interested, feel free to PR with whatever you decide to add. If you want direction or a list of features then you should reach out to me. I'm also in desperate need of an artist and later a sound designer. Please reach out if you're interested and can do either.

I'm also openly taking suggestions for new features, upgrades, enemies or just anything in general!
